# What?

Boilerplate repo for a graphql server using apollo

# Why?

To have a jumping off point and a frame of reference as well as play with some patterns to see what works.

# How do i run it?

Youll need node 14, current LTS at time of writing. NVM use in the repo then.

`npm run dev` - will spin up the server and serve it with reloading on file changes

`npm run logs:pp` - this will `tail` the log file pretty printed, good to have this running on another terminal window.

# tests
